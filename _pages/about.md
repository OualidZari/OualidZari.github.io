I am a third-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Eurecom, Université Sorbonne, specializing in Machine Learning Privacy. My research primarily focuses on constructing privacy attacks against machine learning models and developing privacy-preserving machine learning solutions, with a particular emphasis on differential privacy techniques applicable to real-world data scenarios.

My primary research interests include privacy attacks on machine learning models, privacy-preserving machine learning, differential privacy, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Federated Learning. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI security while developing robust privacy protection mechanisms.

Currently, I'm working on investigating the impact of Large Language Models on graph structure privacy, which has potential implications for enterprise knowledge graph applications. I'm also exploring novel privacy attacks against advanced ML models, including federated learning systems and graph neural networks, while simultaneously developing effective defense strategies.
